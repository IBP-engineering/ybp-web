We appreciate your interest in contributing to the Yogyakarta Book Party official home page! This document outlines the guidelines for contributing code and other improvements to the project.

## Contribution Workflow

1.  **Identify an Issue or Feature:**

- Check the existing issues on the project's GitHub repository to see if your idea has already been proposed.
- If you can't find an existing issue, feel free to create a new one to describe your proposed change.

2.  **Create a Branch:**

- Once you have a clear idea of your contribution, create a new branch from the `main` branch for your changes. This allows you to develop your contribution in isolation without affecting the main codebase.

3.  **Develop and Test:**

- Make your changes and write unit tests to ensure your changes don't break existing functionality.

4.  **Commit Your Changes:**

- Commit your changes with clear and concise commit messages.

5.  **Create a Pull Request:**

- Push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub.
- Open a Pull Request from your branch to the `main` branch of the upstream repository.
- Be sure to describe your changes in detail in the Pull Request description.
